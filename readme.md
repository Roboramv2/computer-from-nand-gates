### Starting off with a NAND gate:
We can build literally all the chips needed for the computer using NAND gates alone. Chip-set required to be built for the project is as follows.
|Class|Chips|
|-----|-----|
|Elementary|not, and, or, xor, mux, demux|
|16-bit|not16, and16, or16, mux16|
|Multi-way|or8way, mux4way16, mux8way16, demux4way, demux8way|
